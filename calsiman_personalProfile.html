    <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
    <p>Currently I am a 1st year college student attending Saint Louis University. 
    <br>I still live at my hometown Baguio City</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="aboutme-col">
        <h3>Early Childhood</h3>
        <p>I was born and raised on Baguio City. I was raised with 2 other siblings
            me being the youngest of us three. I was very annoying when I was younger. I was raised in a 
            rural area where; I was close with my cousins the area was so boring and looked for 
            whatever entertainmentI attended an rural school for my elementary years the 
            population was very little and only befriended 2 person which I still 
            hang out to this day. Not much happens on my early childhood other than
            exploring the area we lived in and playing games outside. The area I was raised in was filled
            with different kind of fruits and berries and basically we could anything that we find like
            though having all the freedom on the fields, It was listless for so long since nothing is happening
            in the area. No source of entertainment any at all. It was also in my early childhood I was
            introduced to technology, though not on my teenage years that I got into it. I learned about
            computers on my early years.Learning about computers was pretty boring. 
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="aboutme-col">
        <h3>Teenage Years</h3>
        <p>On my teenage years, we moved out the rural area moving more to an urban area
            though more populated than that of the childhood home no one really goes out thus prompting
            me to be more inside and it was also that time that I discovered about computer games
            not having anything to do outside and still having curfew. I was stuck at home
            though it was boring at first the more I discover other games the more I find things 
            that would be more of my type of games. I was addicted to it, and it served the purpose
            of passing my time during those times. Found more friends from playing games. I 
            didn't focus on my studies since I found it boring and most of the time I am an outcast at school 
            not that I really care since I found more entertainment online than being at school. Nothing 
            interesting happens in this time though I found interesting people at the 10th grade
            and at senior high school, They are currently my friend group it's pretty fun hanging out with
            them. Playing games with them, though they are now focusing on studies. I am still stuck 
            since I find studying boring and it doesn't interest me but when they are free. I hang out
            them.

            <h3>Saint Martin School Assumption Baguio</h3>
            <p>In elementary I went to Saint Martin Assumption Baguio it is a rural school
                whereat the population is small from prep to grade 6 the total population is still below 200
                the school is small though the area is large and had enough space for everyone to occupy when
                playing. Though me and my friends stayed at the library, I was a troublemaker and 
                I pulled a lot of pranks when I was at elementary. My grades wasn't great but still 
                managed to pass.

            <h3>Baguio City National High School</h3>
            <p>In junior high school I was addicted to computer my social life in school was pretty much dead 
                I was bullied though not that really matters. I was always asleep in the room, In grade 10 I met 
                interesting people. I spent most of my time playing with them online and probably social circle was
                small although it was pretty fun. It was also at this time that I actually learned to be quiet.
                My grades was again subpar but still managed to graduate.

            <h3>University of Baguio</h3>
            <p>In senior high school, I was with the same group of friends in my grade 10 JHS, School was pretty boring
                and the instructors we had are extremely strict againsts the rules. I met more interesting people
                making my friend group larger learning was less boring when I was with them. Although subjects didn't 
                interest me since the lessons taught to was not of my expectations. Though I learned a lot because of the 
                strictness of the teacher. Making my grade normal I never found any motivation.
